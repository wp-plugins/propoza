== Description ==

Propoza's Quotes Extension allows users to send quotation request from the Woo-Commerce front end with a user friendly Request-for-Quote (RFQ) form.

On submitting the RFQ form customers receive an email confirmation for the quote requested. The storeowner is enabled to add a custom price to each requested item and send a proposal back to the customer. The customer will be able to accept or decline the offer via a client dashboard or straight from the email.

After the customer decides to accept of decline the price offer, the storeowner gets a notification about the given choice via the admin dashboard.
When the customer accepts the new proposal offer, the customer is able to checkout with the discounted price.
