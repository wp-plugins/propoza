== Description ==

Propoza's Quotes Extension allows customers to send quotation request from the Woo-Commerce front-end with a user friendly Request-for-Quote (RFQ) form.

On submitting the RFQ form customers and the store administrator receives an email confirmation with the quote request. The storeowner is then able to add a custom price to each requested item and send a proposal back to the customer. The customer will be able to accept or decline the offer via the client dashboard or straight from the email.

After the customer accepts the proposal, he or she will be redirected to the e-commerce checkout to complete the order with a discounted price.
